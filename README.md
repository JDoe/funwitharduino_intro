Fun with Arduino intro class 
============================

This intro course requires no electronics experience, and only minimal programming experience.  Uses the [SparkFun Inventorâ€™s Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12001) plus a few extra things like the [Magician's Chassis](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10825).

Visit [the course website](http://www.funwitharduino.net/intro-class) to learn more.

Overview
--------
* **Class 1: Getting set up and making lights blink** - Get the Arduino set up, learn a little about the Arduino Uno and open source hardware.  Make your first circuit, and construct a traffic light.
* **Class 2: Switches, Knobs, & Sensors** - Improve your traffic light.  Add an arrival sensor, learn about how to read switches with a pull-up circuit and analog inputs.  Learn about various sensors.
* **Class 3: Analog Output and LCD display** - The class turns more to projects.  Learn about PWM and controlling LEDs, build a thermometer with LCD readout and fun tricolor displacy.
* **Class 4: Motors and making things move** - Focus is controlling motors and high power devices.  Build a little robot.
* **Class 5: MATLAB and Arduino** - Learn about MATLAB support for arduino.
